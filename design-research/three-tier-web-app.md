##### Prompt
```
Create a diagram for a three-tier web application with a presentation tier (ALB and CloudFront), application tier (ECS with Fargate), and data tier (Aurora PostgreSQL). Include VPC with public and private subnets across multiple AZs. Also include NAT gateway and Cognito where it is necessary. Also add monitoring and recovery solution. When you create the diagram, check for AWS documentation to ensure it adheres to AWS best practices before you create the diagram, but with a horizontal view and skip the security group icon. After you generated the image, tell me the file name and its location.
